# 1.**COMPUTING**
* CPU(CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT)->The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It's the primary component responsible for executing instructions from programs and managing the operations of the computer.
  
* GPU(GRAPHIC PROCESSING UNIT)->The GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to accelerate the rendering of images and video. It’s optimized for handling the complex calculations required for graphics rendering, making it crucial for visual output in computers, gaming consoles, and mobile devices.
  
* DPU(DATA PROCESSING UNIT)->A DPU, or Data Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to handle data-centric tasks efficiently. It focuses on managing and processing large volumes of data, often in the context of network, storage, and data center operations. 
  
* TPU(TENSOR PROCESSING UNIT)->A TPU, or Tensor Processing Unit, is a type of specialized hardware designed by Google specifically for accelerating machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. TPUs are optimized for processing tensors, which are multidimensional arrays used extensively in machine learning models.

# 2.**operating system**

An operating system (OS) is the software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
It's essentially the backbone of a computer system, enabling users to interact with the hardware and run applications.

* **CISC**->CISC, or Complex Instruction Set Computer, is a type of computer architecture that aims to provide a rich set of instructions for executing a wide variety of tasks directly in hardware.

* **RISC**->RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of computer architecture that focuses on a simplified set of instructions compared to CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architectures. The RISC approach emphasizes efficiency and speed by using a smaller, more streamlined set of instructions.

* **RISC-V**-> is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) design.

* **KERNAL**->The term "kernel" refers to the core component of an operating system (OS) that manages system resources and enables communication between hardware and software.

* **LINUX**->Linux is a widely-used open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for many operating systems, commonly referred to as Linux distributions or distros.

# 3.**NETWORK**
A network is a system that connects multiple devices, allowing them to communicate with each other and share resources.

**TYPES OF NETWORK**
* **LOCAL AREA NETWORK(LAN)**-> A network that connects devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or campus. LANs are typically used to share resources like printers and files and to facilitate communication between devices.

*  **PERSONAL AREA NETWORK(PAN)**->A small-scale network, often used for connecting devices within a personal workspace or home. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks are examples of PANs.

*   **METROPOLITIAN AREA NETWORK(MAN)**->A network that covers a city or a large campus. MANs are often used by municipalities or large organizations to connect multiple buildings or sites within a city.

*   **WIDE AREA NETWORK(WAN)**->A network that covers a city or a large campus. MANs are often used by municipalities or large organizations to connect multiple buildings or sites within a city.

*   **VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK(VPN)**->A network that uses encryption and other techniques to provide secure access to a private network over a public network, like the Internet. VPNs are used to protect sensitive data and allow remote users to access resources securely.

# 4.OSIMODEL(7 LAYERS)->
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a network system into seven distinct layers.

**1. PHYSICAL LAYER->** Deals with the physical aspects of network communication. It involves the transmission and reception of raw binary data (0s and 1s) over physical media such as cables, fibers, or radio waves.

**2. DATA LINK LAYER->** Handles node-to-node data transfer and manages error detection and correction from the Physical layer. It ensures that data packets are correctly formatted for transmission and that errors during transmission are detected and corrected.

**3. NETWORK LAYER->** Manages data routing, forwarding, and addressing across multiple networks. It determines the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination.

**4. TRANSPORT LAYER->**Ensures reliable data transfer between devices. It manages data flow control, error recovery, and retransmission.

**5. SESSION LAYER->** Manages and controls the sessions between applications. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.

**6. PRESENTATION LAYER->**Translates, encrypts, and compresses data for the application layer. It ensures that data is presented in a format that the application layer can understand.

**7. APPLICATION LAYER->**Provides network services directly to end-user applications. It is the closest layer to the end user and interacts with software applications. 

# 5.CLOUD COMPUTING 
Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing resources and services over the internet, allowing users to access and manage resources like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more, on-demand.

# 6.DOMAIN NAME SERVER(DNS)->
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical system used to translate human-friendly domain names  into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. Essentially, DNS acts like the internet’s phone book, converting names into numbers so that computers can locate each other and communicate.

# 7.IP ADDRESS->
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two primary functions:
  * **1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**
    Consists of four sets of numbers separated by dots, where each set is a number between 0 and 255. IPv4 addresses are the most widely used but are limited in number, which has led to exhaustion of available addresses.

* **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**
  Uses a 128-bit address, represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. IPv6 addresses provide a vastly larger address space than IPv4, addressing the issue of address exhaustion.

* **PUBLIC IP**
  An IP address that is globally unique and routable on the internet. It identifies a device or network that can be accessed over the internet.

* **PRIVATE IP**
  An IP address used within a private network that is not routable on the internet. It is used to identify devices within a local network.

# 8.HYPERVISER
A hypervisor is a type of virtualization software that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical host. It provides an abstraction layer between the hardware and the virtual machines, enabling efficient resource allocation and management.

**TYPES OF HYPERVISOR**
1. Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal):Runs directly on the physical hardware of the host machine. It does not require an underlying operating system.
2. Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted): Runs on top of a conventional operating system (the host OS) and relies on the host OS for hardware access.

# 9.VIRTUAL MACHINE->
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical computer but does so within a virtualized environment created by a hypervisor. 

# 10.GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION->
It is a comprehensive data protection law in the European Union (EU). It sets out to protect the privacy and personal data of individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA).
